# W02D02 - Asynchronous Control Flow

### To Do
* [x] Asynchronous Programming
* [x] Blocking vs Non-Blocking
* [x] `setTimeout` and `setInterval`
* [x] File System Functions (`fs`)

### Reading Code
* Always have a guess
* Being wrong is okay (some would argue it's good)
* Try to read code as the computer does

### Event Loop
* Running a cycle that listens for long-running code to finish
